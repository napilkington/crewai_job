Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your organization as an 
AI Agentic Engineer. As a bilingual AI specialist with a Master's degree in 
Artificial Intelligence and Big Data and a degree in Software Development, I 
bring a unique combination of academic excellence and hands-on experience in 
developing cutting-edge Generative AI and Multi-Agent Systems solutions.

My recent experience at AlexandrIA Innovation Hub has provided me with 
extensive exposure to real-world AI engineering challenges. I have successfully 
contributed to the development of multi-agent swarm solutions using Accenture's 
state-of-the-art Swarm Builder platform, creating both front-end and back-end 
swarms of agents for code and documentation generation. This work involved 
close collaboration with cross-functional teams and resulted in a successful 
Minimum Viable Product deployment for a client project.

One of my most rewarding projects was developing the "Talent Finder" Alexia, 
an AI agent built with LangGraph that intelligently matches developers based on 
their technical skills, experience levels, and availability. This project 
showcased my ability to translate business requirements into functional AI 
solutions while maintaining optimal performance and user experience.

My commitment to Responsible AI is demonstrated through my work on the 
"Constitutions" Proof of Concept project, where I developed and deployed a 
large language model specifically engineered to detect toxicity in user queries. 
This initiative directly supported ethical AI practices and ensured safe, 
responsible deployment of AI-powered agents.

I am particularly skilled in:

  • Developing and orchestrating multi-agent systems using LangGraph, 
    LangChain, CrewAI, and proprietary frameworks
  • Implementing large language models with advanced techniques such as RAG 
    and prompt engineering
  • Building MLOps pipelines with MLFlow, AWS Sagemaker, and Azure AI Foundry
  • Ensuring AI solutions adhere to Responsible AI principles and ethical 
    guidelines

As a C2-level English speaker fluent in both English and Spanish, I bring 
strong communication skills that enable me to collaborate effectively with 
diverse, international teams and clearly articulate complex technical concepts 
to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve while 
maintaining a strong ethical framework. I am eager to bring my expertise in 
agentic AI, multi-agent systems, and responsible AI practices to your 
organization and contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful 
impact.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and 
enthusiasm align with your team's goals. Thank you for considering my 
application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your 
organization's AI initiatives.

Sincerely,

N. Pilkington González
